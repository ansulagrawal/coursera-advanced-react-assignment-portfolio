# React Portfolio Assignment

This is an assignment for the Advance React course on Coursera by Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate. The goal of this assignment is to create a portfolio website using React. The website will showcase your work and provide information about your skills and experience.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you can either clone the repository or download the ZIP file. Once you have the code on your machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

## Usage
To start the development server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  npm start
```
This will start the development server and launch the website in your default browser. You can make changes to the code and see the changes reflected in real-time on the website.


## Folder Structure
The project follows a standard React folder structure:

```java
project/
├── public/
|   ├── index.html
|   ├── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Alert.js
│   │   ├── Card.js
│   │   ├── ContactMeSection.js
│   │   ├── Footer.js

│   │   ├── photo1.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── App.js
